Before we start the lesson, let's take a moment to think about the land on which we are learning and teaching. 

I'm teaching this lesson from Edmonton, Alberta. The [city of Edmonton](https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/indigenous-relations-office) is located on [Treaty Six Territory](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/arts/arts101/treaty_6_information.html). 

This territory has been a home, a trading post, a travelling route, and more for generations of Indigenous Peoples. In particular, the nêhiyaw (Nay-hee-yow) / Cree, Dene (Deh-neyh), Anishinaabe (Ah-nish-in-ah-bay) / Saulteaux (So-toe), Nakota Isga (Na-koh-tah ee-ska) / Nakota Sioux (Na-koh-tah sue), and Niitsitapi (Nit-si-tahp-ee) / Blackfoot peoples have lived, learned, and work in this place for centuries. This land is also a homeland for the Métis, and the home of one of the largest communities of Inuit south of the 60th parallel. 

In this map from [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/) you can see a pin representing Edmonton.

Land acknowledgements are just one small piece of the work of reconciliation and must be undertaken in conjunction with other works. Acknowledging the land provides a foundation for recognizing Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination, for respecting Indigenous culture and language, and for committing to reconciliation and allyship.
