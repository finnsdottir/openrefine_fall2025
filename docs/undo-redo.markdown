# Using Undo and Redo in OpenRefine

It's not uncommon to make a mistake, or to change your mind about something, when cleaning data. With this is mind, OpenRefine provides a very easy way to undo and redo any and all changes you've made. 

In the left hand margin, you should see a tab labelled **Undo/Redo**. Click on it. 
<figure markdown="span">

Every operation you've run so far will be listed in this tab. To undo changes, all you have to do is click on a previous step. To redo that change, just click on it. 

!!! example "Practice"
    Try undoing all the transformations you did to the **writers_name** variable. Select a step before those changes and observe what happens to the variable values. 

Now, re-select the most recent change. Your data should go back to how it was.
